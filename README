This is a PHP package for interfacing with the Edurep search engine. It consists of two parts, EdurepSearch and EdurepResults.

In EdurepSearch you can set optional search parameters like a query or the number of records it should return, and perform a query for LOM or SMO records.

In EdurepResults you can load a raw XML Edurep resultstring and retrieve a result object.

Requirements:
 - PHP 5.1 or higher compiled with curl and simplexml

Usage:
View the example.php for details using this package.


The following table shows the currently supported LOM response fields; if the field is returned single- or multivalued and whether the field is returned with recordSchema lom or oai_dc, or x-recordSchema extra. 

                                        #       lom     oai_dc  extra
