This is a PHP package for interfacing with the Edurep search engine. It consists of two parts, EdurepSearch and EdurepResults.

In EdurepSearch you can set optional search parameters like a query or the number of records it should return, and perform a query for LOM or SMO records.

In EdurepResults you can load a raw XML Edurep resultstring and retrieve a result object.

Requirements:
 - PHP 5.1 or higher compiled with curl and simplexml

Usage:
View the example.php for details using this package.


The following table shows the currently supported LOM response fields; if the field is returned single- or multivalued and whether the field is returned with recordSchema lom or oai_dc, or x-recordSchema extra. 

                                        #       lom     oai_dc  extra

If any of technical duration or typicallearningtime exist, they are converted to seconds and aggregated to the time key in the record array. So if any duration is present in the metadata, it's available in the time key, with typicallearningtime taking precedence.
